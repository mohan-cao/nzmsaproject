# Weather app

A fully working weather app, built on mixed jQuery/JS and HTML5 (+ css)
Utilises Yahoo! weather API, which I will be getting a key for, and the builtin Geolocation API if available (or else fallback to manual input).

Built initially as a challenge for FreeCodeCamp, I've integrated it and redesigned certain aspects of it for use on an actual web server.
This project is on continuous deployment in Microsoft Azure, and any changes that occur here will be reflected on the server (as soon as possible).
